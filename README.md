This is the firmware of the 5x15 ortholinear keyboard I built. 

It runs on a teensy 3.6 and features a Bela Trill Bar capacitive touch strip for your thumb on the palmrest below where a normal sized spacebar would sit. it has a sort-of-faux 6-key rollover(not including layer and modifier keys) because that's the built in and completely fucking arbitrary limitation on the arduino keyboard library. I have tried to modify this, but gave up because I realized I never need to press more than 6 keys at once while gaming or anything else. 

I may upload pictures and STL files some day. I consider this a prototype for a better version that I will eventually get around to designing, so don't count on it. 

I'm using this more as a backup for my own purposes than anything else. 

Feel free to copy, that's how I got a third of the code in here anyway.
